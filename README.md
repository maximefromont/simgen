## Project Description

The *Sims Build Challenge Generator* is a fun desktop tool developed to help sims player to come up with new challenges ideas.
The software takes multiple parameters and settings into accounts and generate a new challenge randomly. It includes for example :

- A random numbers of sims with randoms ages
- A random number of rooms and floors in your house
- A random challenge challengeColour picked in a list of funny colours names

And many mores !

## Project Installation

You can simply download this tool as an executable .jar file. You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/maximefromont/sims-challenge-generator/releases).

In order to launch this tool, you will need java 1.8 or a more recent version installed on your computer.

You can check your java version by typing `java --version` and pressing enter in your operating system command prompt.

## Project Usage

Simply open the .jar tool by double clicking on it. If this doesn't work, you can also use the command prompt of your system and type 

`java -jar <path-of-the-jar-file>`. 

(Don't forget to include the ".jar" at the end of the file name.

You can also naviguate to the directory where you saved the .jar tool and type 
`java -jar simgen.jar`.

For example if you saved it in Documents, enter those prompts :

* `cd Documents`
* `java -jar simgen.jar`

Assuming that you didn't rename the .jar tool. If so, simply use the name you gave it.

Each time the tool open, you should obtain a random set of parameters for your sims challenge.

## Future Improvements

Here are some functionalities that I would like to add in the future:

- Settings adjustment before generating
- Ability to re-generate without closing and reopening the tool
- Ability to save the challenge as an image or a text file for example
- Ability to share the challenge
